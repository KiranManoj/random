Key Concepts: 
1. Working Directory - Your actual files on disk
2. Staging Area(index) - A list of files to include in the next commit.
3. Local Repo - The saved versions (commits)
4. Remote Repo - The Github version.

Commands to master:
1. git status - shows what's changed and what's staged.
2. git diff - shows changes between working dir and staging area.
3. git diff --staged - shows changes that are staged but not committed.
4. git restore <file> - undo changes in working directory.
5. git reset <file> - unstage a file.
6. git rm <file> - deletes file and stages that deletion.
