Key Concepts: 
1. Working Directory - Your actual files on disk
2. Staging Area(index) - A list of files to include in the next commit.
3. Local Repo - The saved versions (commits)
4. Remote Repo - The Github version.

Commands to master:
1. git status - shows what's changed and what's staged.
2. git diff - shows changes between working dir and staging area.
